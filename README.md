# TomcatDerby
Source code from the ZetCode's Tomcat Derby tutorial. In the tutorial, we create small web application with NetBeans, Tomcat, and Derby. In addition, we use the three-layer, controller, and DAO software patterns. For the presentation layer, we use JSP pages and JSTL tags. The example also uses pure.css library to help design the UI of the application.
